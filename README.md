## Running your own bot

### 1. Replace [`knowledge-base.txt`](./knowledge-base.txt) with your own knowledge-base

- Delete the existing .ext
- Add your stuff in [`knowledge-base`](./knowledge-base)
- Run `python concat.py` to compile the above folder into [`knowledge-base.txt`](./knowledge-base.txt) 

### 2. Set `OPENAI_API_KEY` and `TELEGRAM_TOKEN` environment variables.

- `OPENAI_API_KEY`: https://platform.openai.com/api-keys
- `TELEGRAM_TOKEN`: https://t.me/BotFather

> You can test requests using `python request.py` without a telegram token

### 3. Override instructions and `owner_id` to fit your usage.

- You can find your owner id at https://t.me/username_to_id_bot

### 4. Run or deploy to cloud

- run locally with docker, or: `pip install -r "requirements.txt"` then `python bot.py`
- or deploy to cloud with https://fly.io: `flyctl deploy --ha=false` (atm the script only supports 1 machine, check the example [`fly.toml`](./fly.toml))
- add bot in a group and use `/add_group groupid` to whitelist it and the bot is ready to answer questions with `/prompt` whenever you want

### 5. Configure the bot

- `/add_admin your_id` to add yourself as an admin
- `/add_group group_id` to add a new group with rate limiting of 10 messages/day
