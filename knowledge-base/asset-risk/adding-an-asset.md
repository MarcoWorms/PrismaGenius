# Adding an Asset

When adding an asset to Prisma a thorough analysis must be made by the Prisma community to ensure that the asset will add more value than risk to the protocol. The initial step for any asset to be added to Prisma is to request an asset risk assessment by the independent Prisma Risk team. The asset risk assessment offers a framework to assess and compare risks the asset might have to the protocol, and how to calibrate model asset parameters to mitigate those risks.

After assessing all the risks of the asset, a DAO proposal is required to be drafted by the individual or team looking to add an asset as collateral on Prisma. The Prisma DAO will assess the asset risk assessment and the proposal and vote on whether the asset should be listed as collateral on Prisma.
