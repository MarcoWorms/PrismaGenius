# Introduction

Prisma introduces a novel tokenomics framework, carefully designed to drive towards a path of decentralization and autonomy of the Prisma protocol. The approach covers governance mechanisms and financial incentives aimed to align various shareholders within the Prisma ecosystem. The PRISMA token is at the core of this framework, serving as a securing element of the Prisma protocol.
