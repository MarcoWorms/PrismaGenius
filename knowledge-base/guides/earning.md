# Earning

Prisma Earn provides users access to various earning possibilities on both `mkUSD` and `PRISMA`.

To start earning on Prisma, visit the **EARN** tab and pick between the various options that are available. Users can choose to stake their mkUSD via the stability pool, or build a Curve and Convex LP position directly on Prisma. This offers users access to additional emission-boosting mechanisms.
