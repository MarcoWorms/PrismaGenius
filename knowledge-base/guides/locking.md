# Locking

Vote lock PRISMA tokens in order to participate in gauge weight or governance votes and claim protocol rewards.

### Step by step

*   1. Navigate to **PRISMA** at the top of the page
*   2. Enter the quantity of PRISMA tokens you would like to lock and the duration of the lock from 1-52 weeks.
*   3. Users can monitor their locks at **Your Locks** and choose to **Enable Auto Lock.** Auto locking freezes your locks so users don't have to relock, saving gas.
    
## Boost Delegation

In return for locking PRISMA you receive [Boost](/governance/emissions-boosting). Any unused boost gained from locking PRISMA can be rented out to other participants on Prisma. An optional fee can be set for renting out unused boost allowing users to earn a share of the PRISMA rewards the rentee earns. Fees earned are visible on the rewards page and are subject to a lock period upon claim.
