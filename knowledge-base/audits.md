Audits
======

Security is the top priority here at Prisma and alongside internal best practices through extensive testing, the Prisma protocol is additionally assessed by an independent risk team and external auditors.

Prisma's independent risk assessment team is led by [Llamarisk](https://twitter.com/PrismaRisk). Prisma is audited by [Nomoi](https://www.nomoi.xyz/), [Mixbytes](https://mixbytes.io/) and [Zellic](https://www.zellic.io/).
