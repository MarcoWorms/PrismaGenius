# ðŸŒˆ What is Prisma Finance

A non-custodial and decentralized Ethereum LST-backed stablecoin.

Prisma is a new DeFi primitive focused on realizing the full potential of Ethereum liquid staking tokens (LSTs). Prisma enables users to mint a stablecoin, **mkUSD,** that is fully collateralized by liquid staking tokens. The stablecoin will be incentivized on Curve and Convex Finance to create a capital-efficient flywheel where users can receive trading fees, CRV, CVX, and PRISMA on top of their Ethereum staking rewards. The Prisma codebase is completely immutable, based on Liquity, creating a robust protocol and truly decentralized stablecoin with favorable and flexible collateral parameters. These features make it attractive for those wanting to get the best out of their LSTs without tail risks from other stablecoins. The Prisma DAO will be in charge of parameters, emissions, and protocol fees.

### Who uses Prisma?

Prisma is an incredibly useful tool for a diverse set of actors within the DeFi space.

Holders of liquid staking tokens can make their assets more productive, by using them as collateral to mint a stablecoin (mkUSD) to partake across DeFi.

Issuers of liquid staking tokens benefit from using Prisma as they can incentivize actions on Prisma that would help deepen the liquidity of their liquid staking token.

*   Incentivize minting mkUSD with their own LST
*   Redirecting emissions toward minting with a certain collateral
*   Redirecting emissions to keep an active borrow with a certain collateral
*   Redirecting emissions to any LP tokens staker that may be relevant to Prisma
